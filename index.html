            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> As a Staff Associate II at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, 
                I lead the ingestion of oceanographic vessel data as part of the Rolling Deck to Repository 
                Program (R2R), ensuring the long-term preservation and distribution of environmental sensor 
                data collected by United States academic research fleets. I have decided to pivot away from 
                managing oceanographic data and will be joining Wesleyan University as a graduate student in
                Earth & Planetary Science in Fall 2025. <br>
                <br>
                I also perform quality assessment and control of ship-based multibeam data for the Global Multi-Resolution Topography (GMRT) synthesis, 
                a high-resolution global seafloor map. <br>
                <br>
                I have a Bachelor of Science (BASc) in Geology/Earth Science from City University of New York City College, 
                and a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Anthropology/Archaeology from Hunter College. 
                I have extensive geoscience research experience,including classifying soil samples, rock cores, and groundwater, deploying air monitoring equipment, 
                and analyzing geospatial data using ESRI ArcGIS. I am motivated by data-led policy innovation 
                to address environmental and societal issues. I am interested climate technology, policy, 
                sustainability, and open access to scientific data for all.
