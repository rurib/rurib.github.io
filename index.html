            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> As a Staff Associate II at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, 
                I lead the ingestion of oceanographic vessel data as part of the Rolling Deck to Repository 
                Program (<a href="https://www.rvdata.us/">R2R</a>), ensuring the long-term preservation and 
                distribution of environmental sensor data collected by United States academic research fleets and quality assessment and control of ship-based multibeam data for the Global Multi-Resolution Topography (GMRT) synthesis, 
                a high-resolution global seafloor map. 
                I have since decided to pivot away from managing oceanographic data and will be joining 
                <a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/ees/graduate/index.html">Wesleyan University</a> as a graduate student in
                Earth & Planetary Science in Fall 2025. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I have a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Geology/Earth Science from City University of New York City College, 
                and a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Anthropology/Archaeology from Hunter College. 
                I have extensive geoscience research experience, including classifying soil samples, rock cores, and groundwater, deploying air monitoring equipment, 
                and analyzing geospatial data using ESRI ArcGIS. I am motivated by outreach to unrepresented groups in the science and 
                open access to data for all.
